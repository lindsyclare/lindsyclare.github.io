        <p>My name is Lindsy Clare. I am 24 years old and live in Kansas City, Missouri. I am in my second year of teaching at Liberty Public Schools. I am teaching special education in an elementary school. I got both of my Bachelor’s Degree's at Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville, Missouri. I am currently working on my Master’s Degree in Learning Technologies and Design with a focus area of Technology in schools. I am getting this degree through the University of Missouri. My hobbies include reading, playing with my dog, Goober, and I have recently picked up cooking. I love to read mystery books and professional development books. I like to research better instructional practices to use in my classroom. For cooking, I like to find different recipes for chicken. I feel like it is the easiest thing to cook for a beginner like me.</p>
        <p>Experience Overview: I currently teach special education at Liberty Public Schools. I teach in an elementary resource classroom. I work with students that have anything from Autism to a Specific Learning Disability.</p>
