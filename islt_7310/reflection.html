    <p class="k">As an elementary special education teacher, I believe that all students are unique and have something special they can bring to their own education. I will assist my students to be advocates for themselves and accept themselves for who they are. Every student learns differently. Just because it takes a student longer to understand a concept or explaining it in a different way doesn’t mean they are incapable of learning.</p>
    <p class="l">My role as the teacher will be to assist each child in developing their own potential and learning styles. I will present differentiated lessons so students can access the regular education curriculum. I will reach to different learning styles and make content relative to the students’ lives. I will also incorporate hands-on learning, cooperative learning, and individual work to engage students and appeal to their different learning styles.</p>
    <p class="m">I believe that teaching is a collaborative job. I am constantly learning from your students, colleagues, parents, and the community.  I am learning new strategies, new ideas, and new philosophies. To continue my learning and improve my teaching, I will read books, case studies, talk to my colleagues, and talk to my students.</p>
