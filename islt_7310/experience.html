            <h3>Young Athletes Program</h3>
            <p>Company Name: Young Athletes Program</p>
            <p>From: August 2015  To: December 2015</p>
            <p>Description of Position: Set up games for the children to participate in.</p>
            <p>Reflection: I participated in the Young Athletes Program when I was in college at Northwest Missouri State University. I helped set up games and activities for children with disabilities to participate in. During this experience, I learned how to modify games so that children with disabilities can participate. This knowledge would be helpful during a PE class that has a child with a physical disability.</p><br><br><br>

            <h3>Student Teaching</h3>
            <p>Company Name: Park Hill School District</p>
            <p>From: January 2018  To: April 2018</p>
            <p>Description of Position: Shadow a teacher and eventually co-teach with that teacher.</p>
            <p>Reflection: I student taught in an elementary school in a special education classroom for 12 weeks and a 3rd grade classroom for 4 weeks. During this time, I was observing the classroom teacher and learning how to prepare lessons and classroom management techniques. I also co-taught with the teacher to learn better instruction techniques and learn how to differentiate my instruction.</p><br><br><br>

            <h3>Summer School Teacher</h3>
            <p>Company Name: Park Hill School District</p>
            <p>From: June 2018  To: July 2018</p>
            <p>Description of Position: Follow lesson plans prepared by the district to teach a class of second graders.</p>
            <p>Reflection: During this job I taught a second grade class. This was my first real teaching experience outside of student teaching. I learned so much during this experience. I learned how I wanted to set up my classroom, techniques to deliver lessons, classroom management strategies, and how to collaborate with teachers. If I were to do anything different during this job, I would have had a better classroom management technique. I would have had my students help me set up the classroom rules.</p>
