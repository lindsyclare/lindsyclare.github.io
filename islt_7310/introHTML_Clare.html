 My name is Lindsy Clare. I am in my second year of teaching Special Education in a resource classroom in Liberty, Missouri. I have 2nd graders and 5th graders this year. I am in my first semester at Mizzou and am working towards my Master’s in Learning Technologies and Design with a focus area of Technology in Schools. I do not have any previous web application or development training or experience. My sister and her boyfriend are both getting their bachelor’s degree in this type of area so they have been some help to me so far. My expectation for this course is to learn how to make a website. With my learned web development skills, I hope to be able to make my own classroom website for my students and parents to use. My favorite hobby would be reading. I love to not only read books for pleasure, but I like to read about instructional practices for teaching and how I can try new things in my classroom. In my free time I like to spend time with my family. My husband and I are currently living with them until we find a house. I love the extra time I’m getting with my dogs Goober, Fritz, and Marlo!
